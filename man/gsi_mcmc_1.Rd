\title{MCMC from the simplest GSI model for pi and the individual posterior probabilities}
\usage{
gsi_mcmc_1(
  SL,
  Pi_init,
  lambda,
  reps,
  burn_in,
  sample_int_Pi,
  sample_int_PofZ,
  sample_total_catch = 0L,
  total_catch_vals = as.integer(c(-1))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SL}{matrix of the scaled likelihoods.  This is should have values for each individual in a column
(going down in the rows are values for different populations).}

\item{Pi_init}{Starting value for the pi (collection mixture proportion) vector.}

\item{lambda}{the prior to be added to the collection allocations, in order to
generate pseudo-count Dirichlet parameters for the simulation of a new pi vector}

\item{reps}{total number of reps (sweeps) to do.}

\item{burn_in}{how many reps to discard in the beginning when doing the mean calculation. They will still be
returned in the traces if desired}

\item{sample_int_Pi}{the number of reps between samples being taken for Pi traces.  If 0 no trace samples are taken}

\item{sample_int_PofZ}{the number of reps between samples being taken for the traces of posterior of each individual's origin. If 0
no trace samples are taken.}

\item{sample_total_catch}{integer. Set it to 1 if you want to sample the total-stock specific catch. If so,
then you have to set `total_catch_vals` appropriately.}

\item{total_catch_vals}{an integer vector of length reps that holds the total catch.  It is a vector to allow
for this to be a sample from the posterior for the total catch.}
}
\value{
\code{gsi_mcmc_1} returns a list of three. \code{$mean} lists the posterior
means for collection proportions \code{pi} and for the individual posterior
probabilities of assignment \code{PofZ}. \code{$sd} returns the posterior standard
deviations for the same values.

If the corresponding \code{sample_int} variables are not 0, \code{$trace} contains
samples taken from the Markov chain at intervals of \code{sample_int_}(variable) steps.
}
\description{
Using a matrix of scaled likelihoods, this function samples values of pi and the posteriors
for all the individuals.  It returns the output in a list.

# this demonstrates it with scaled likelihoods computed from
# assignment of the reference samples
