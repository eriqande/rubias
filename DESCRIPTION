Description: Implements Bayesian inference for the conditional genetic 
    stock identification model.  It allows inference of mixed fisheries and also 
    simulation of mixtures to predict accuracy.  A full description of the underlying
    methods is available in a recently published article in the
    Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences: <doi:10.1139/cjfas-2018-0016>.
