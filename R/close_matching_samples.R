#' check for matching (or close to matching) genotypes in a data frame
#'
#' Super simple function that looks at all pairs of fish from the data frame and
#' returns a tibble that includes those which shared a fraction >= than min_frac_non_miss
#' of the genotypes not missing in either fish, and which were matching at a fraction >= min_frac_matching
#' of those non-missing pairs of genotypes.
#' @param D a two-column format genetic dataset, with "repunit", "collection", and "indiv"
#' columns, as well as a "sample_type" column that has entries either of "reference" or of
#' both "reference" and "mixture."
#' @param min_frac_non_miss the fraction of loci that the pair must share non missing in order to be reported
#' @param min_frac_matching the fraction of shared non-missing loci that must be shared between the indivdiuals
#' to be reported as a matching pair.
