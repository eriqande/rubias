#' SNP data from chinook reference populations
#'
#' Chinook salmon baseline data similar to that which can be
#' downloaded from \url{https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.574sv}.
#' This data set includes 91 SNPs and 7301 fish and is what the Dryad data became
#' after we converted from TaqMan to SNPtype assays (being forced to toss some loci)
#' and tossed out a bunch of lousy historical
#' samples from Trinity River.
#' @format A tbl_df-ed (from dplyr) data frame with 7,301 rows and 185 variables. The first
#' three columns are
#' \describe{
#'   \item{repunit (chr)}{the reporting unit that the individual is in}
#'   \item{pop (chr)}{the population from which the individual was sampled}
#'   \item{ID (chr)}{Unique identifier of the individual fish}
#' }
#' The remaining columns are two columns for each locus.  These columns are named like,
#' "Locus.1" and "Locus.2" for the first and second gene copies at that locus.  For example,
#' "Ots_104569-86.1" and  "Ots_104569-86.2".  The locus columns are ints and missing data
#' is denoted by NA.
