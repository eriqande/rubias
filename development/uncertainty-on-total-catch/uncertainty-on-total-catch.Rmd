The R package 'rubias,' like most other mixed-stock analysis programs, implements
a typical finite mixture model.  In such a model, a key parameter is the proportion
of different components present in the population from which the samples are being
taken.  We call this parameter $\bpi = (\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_K)$ which includes a proportion
for each of the $K$ components in the mixture.  In the mixed-stock fisheries context,
$\bpi$ holds the stock-specific proportions that are present _in the ocean_ at the
time and location of sampling.  

While $\bpi$ is clearly a necessary variable in a mixture model---it is essential
to model the population proportions---it might not always be the ultimate target
of interest.  A germane example of this occurs when directly managing fisheries using
genetic stock identification (GSI).  In these cases, managers may be particularly
interested in the numbers of fish from different populations or reporting units
that occur in the total catch from a particular fishery (or across multiple fisheries).

Because fisheries might be managed so as to limit the impacts on a particular weak stock
to below a certain threshold, it is important to be able to evaluate the
uncertainty in these estimates of stock-specific total catch.  This
vignette describes how to do that with the newly updated version of 'rubias' that
provides such functionality.  Before describing the details, however, we explain
why propagating the uncertainty found in the Monte
Carlo sample of $\bpi$ does not accurately reflect uncertainty in stock-specific
total catch, and we describe the newly implemented approach in 'rubias' for evaluating
uncertainty in stock-specific total catch in a rigorous way within the
Bayesian framework used by 'rubias.'

## Uncertainty in $\bpi$ is not uncertainty in stock-specific total catch

Although the uncertainty in $\bpi$ can affect the amount of uncertainty
in stock-specific total catch, the two cannot be directly equated because uncertainty
in $\bpi$ always reflects the variability due to having drawn a random sample. By
contrast, the sample itself is a fixed part of the total catch. The implications of
this are easiest to understand when the entire catch has been sampled for GSI.  For,
example, imagine that the total catch was 300 fish, all 300 of those fish are subject
to GSI, and the population of origin of fish from stock $x$ can be identified
with no error using genetics.  If 20 fish originated from stock
$x$, then the total catch from stock $x$ is 20, with no error.  However, the 90%
credible interval on the proportion of fish from stock $x$ in the ocean would
be, from the binomial distribution, (0.043, 0.09).
If this variation were applied to the total catch, it would erroneously suggest
that between 13 and 27 fish from stock $x$ were in the catch, when it is clear that
exactly 20 fish from $x$ were in the catch!

```{r, include=FALSE}
CI <-  qbinom(
  p = c(0.05, 0.95),
  size = 300,
  prob = 20/300
) / 300
```

The above example is simple and contrived.  It serves well to illustrate that
the uncertainty around $\bpi$ cannot be directly used to quantify the uncertainty
in stock-specific total catch.  However, unlike our simple example, stock-specific
total catch will typically be affected by other sources of variation such as
uncertainty in genetic assignment, subsampling of the total catch for genetic
analysis, as well as simply uncertainty in the estimates of the actual total catch.
Fortunately, all of these sources of uncertainty can now be accounted for in a rigorous
way within the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling framework of 'rubias,' providing users with an MCMC
sample of the stock-specific total catch for each stock.  This MCMC sample can then
be summarized however desired, or it can be fed into further analyses. The next
section describes the statistical background on how 'rubias' provides an MCMC
sample of the stock-specific total catch.  


## MCMC for stock-specific total catch

```{r standard, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Acyclic directed graph showing the standard conditional GSI model. Diamond nodes are deterministic values used for priors. Circular nodes are variables. The shaded, circular nodes denote variables that are observed and the unshaded circular nodes are variables whose values are updated and sampled during the MCMC process."}
if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics("images/standard-model-crop.pdf")
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("images/standard-model-crop.png")
}
```

Figure 1 shows the acyclic directed graph (DAG) used in the conditional
GSI model implemented in 'rubias.'
The stock proportion vector in the ocean, $\bpi$, is visible just below $\blambda^{(\pi)}$, which
is a parameter vector for the prior on $\bpi$.  There are $M$ fish in the reference
baseline data set.
$\bZ^*_j$ is the known origin of fish $j$ in the baseline, while $\bY^*_j$ is its
observed genotype. $\bZ_i$ is an indicator vector giving the unknown origin of the
$i\thh$ fish from the mixture, and $\bY_i$ is the genotype data from that fish, $i$.
$\btheta_\ell$ are the unknown population allele freqeunces at locus $\ell$, and
$\bgamma_\ell$ are the priors on those frequencies.  MCMC
sampling in this model proceeds using Gibbs sampling, with $\bpi$, $\bZ_i$, and
$\btheta_\ell$ being updated during each sweep of the algorithm by drawing each
new value from its full conditional distribution.

```{r stock-spec, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Acyclic directed graph showing the augemented standard conditional GSI model to include additional fish in the catch that were not inlcluded in the GSI analysis."}
if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
  knitr::include_graphics("images/stock-spec-catch-model-crop.pdf")
} else {
  knitr::include_graphics("images/stock-spec-catch-model-crop.png")
}
```



In order to sample from a posterior distribution for the stock-specific total
catch, we introduce the indicator vectors $\bZ^r_k$, $k=1,\ldots,R$, giving
the unknown origin of each of the $R$ fish in the total catch that remain
after the fish used in the GSI analysis are removed from the total catch. The DAG for that model
appears in Figure 2. Sampling in this new model proceeds exactly as before, except
that in every sweep we also simulate values for the $R$ different $\bZ^r_k$ vectors from their
full conditional distribution, which is simply a multinomial sample of size 1 from
cell probabilities that are the current values of $\bpi$:
$$
\bZ^r_k \sim \mathrm{Multinomial}(1, \bpi),~~\mathrm{for}~k=1,\ldots,R.
$$
At the conclusion of each sweep a sample from the posterior distribution of the
stock-specific total catch is obtained by summing over all the $\bZ^r_k$ and
$\bZ_i$ vectors,
$$
C_\mathrm{ss} = \sum_{k=1}^R \bZ^r_k + \sum_{i=1}^N \bZ_i.
$$

It is worth pointing out that the size of the total catch, $R$, might itself be
estimated with some uncertainty.  So long as the true size of the total catch can be
safely assumed to be conditionally independent of the stock composition given the
estimated total catch, the uncertainty in $R$
can be propagated into the stock specific total catch by supplying a sample of $R$
from its posterior disribution.  Different values from that posterior sample can be
used for $R$ in each sweep that 'rubias' performs.  This presents no problems, so long
as no samples from the posterior for total catch are less than $N$, the number of fish
genotyped and used for GSI, which should clearly not occur.  

## Implementation

Here is how I am planning to implement this, from the user's perspective.

The plan is to implement this by allowing users to supply another variable called
`total_catch` to the `infer_mixture()` function in rubias.  The variable `total_catch`
must be a tibble with the two columns: `mixture_collection` and `catch`.  This is necessary
because 'rubias' can analyze mixtures from multiple locations separately from a
single tibble of genotypes.  In each row, the `catch` column can contain either a
single integer, in which case that value is assumed to be $R$ for every sweep for that
particular mixture.  Or the entry in `catch` can be vector of integers.  If so, that
vector, is assumed to be a sample from the posterior distibution for the
total catch and each value will be used for $R$, successively, and recycled as
needed.

The `total_catch` option will only be available with `method = "MCMC"`.  

When the `total_catch` option is given, the output list from `infer_mixture()` will
include a component called `total_catch_posterior_sample` that will include the
sampled values of $C_\mathrm{ss}$ over all sweeps of the MCMC algorithm.
